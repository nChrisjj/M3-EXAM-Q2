            Hi! I'm <span class="highlight">Marc </span> <br/>
            Photographer & Entrepreneur.

          <p>
            Hi, I'm Marc Pacaldo a college student who majors in Computer Science at Malayan Colleges Mindanao. 
            I'm a good cook, I love being creative and cooking with my mom. I love taking photos of people and especially nature. 
            I also listen to music, play some games, playing sports, and do coding. 
            I also love riding bikes and explore the different trails and spots of a city. 
            I am also a time-oriented person because I like being on time with anything especially with my tasks.  
            Also I plan ahead my schedules because I really hate unplanned events and the things that I need to do. 
            Traveling with my family is also one of my favorite things to do when we all have spare time, 
            I cherish those moments that we spend together because not all the time we get to bond as a family because of busy schedules and work. 
            The person who introduced me about computers is my father. 
            When I was a kid, he is the one who taught me the different functions of a computer and its programs and parts. 
            It influenced me and turned me into what I am now a Computer Science.
