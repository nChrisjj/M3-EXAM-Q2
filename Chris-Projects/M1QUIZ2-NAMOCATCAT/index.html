            Hi! I'm <span class="highlight">Chris </span> <br/>
            Professional Dota2 Player.

          <p>
            Hi, I'm Chris John Namocatcat, a college student who majors in Information Science at Malayan Colleges Mindanao. 
            I'm a professional Dota 2 player. I love to play dota every day and I've been playing Dota for almost a decade. I also love to cook. 
            I also listen to music, play some games, especially my main game, playing sports, and lastly, do coding.
            Going out for a cup of coffee or some healthy snacks is also one of my favorite things to do when i have a sparetime and also having a bonding time with my family.
            I treasure the time that we spend together as a family because we don't get to spend as much time together as we would want because of our hectic schedules and jobs.
            The person who introduced me to computers is my older brother. 
            When I was a kid, he was the one who taught me to play Dota and influenced me in programming when I was a kid, which is why I'm here and doing this task.
